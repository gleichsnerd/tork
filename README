**DESCRIPTION**
A MATLAB remake of the 1980 text-based RPG classic, Zork. This project was done 
with a partner for an intro to MATLAB course. It's a little broken, possibly 
due to changes between MATLAB editions, and also because MATLAB doesn't have
a native text-based GUI or easy ways to create multi-layered maps.

Sidenote, the gui editor for arrays is awful in Matlab, as well as file reading 
and extension support. 

**RUNNING THE PROGRAM**
Make sure you open the tork.m file in the same directory as the other files.
You can either start the program through the built-in command window by typing 

>> tork

or by pressing run in the IDE.

**GAMEPLAY**

First click the bottom of the window to access the command box. 
Enter directional commands (i.e. north, south) or action commands when 
appropriate (i.e. attack <target>).

That's about it. 

Enjoy what a friend and I crunched out in a day in a psuedo computer language.
